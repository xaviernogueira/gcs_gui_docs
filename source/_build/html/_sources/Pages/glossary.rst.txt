    Topo-bathymetric DEM
        A raster modeling the elevation of a river valley's bare ground topography, whether under water or not. 
        Can typically be constructed from traditional LiDAR data collected for an ephemeral river during a no-flow period,
        or using topo-bathyemtric / 'green' LiDAR. 
    
    Thalweg
        A line following the lowest part of a valley whether under water or not.

    Flow stage elevation 
        The water surface elevation relative to the thalweg's elevation. Serves as an inverse proxy for water depth.     

    Nested topography
        In the context of fluvial geomorphology, nested topography refers to the additive scales of topography that river flow
        interacts with across a range of increasing flow stages. The topography controlling hydraulics at a low flow is literally nested within a 
        larger scale of topography that a interacts with higher flows. For example, the toporgaphy of an active channel of a low flows exists as a part of
        a flood flow's active channel topogaphy, which may also includes floodplain, and valley scale elements. In GCS analysis, we study a given
        cross-section's relative geometry at different flow stages in order to capture any cross-section nesting trends/patterns across the river area of interest.
